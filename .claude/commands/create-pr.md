**For any UI/visual changes:**
- Use the Playwright MCP to capture screenshots of all modified or new screens
- Upload the screenshots directly to the PR description
- Organize screenshots with clear labels (e.g., "Before" and "After" for modifications, or "New Feature: [Feature Name]" for additions)
- Include captions explaining what each screenshot demonstrates

## 2. High-Level Summary

**Provide a concise overview that includes:**
- **What changed:** Brief description of the modifications (2-3 sentences)
